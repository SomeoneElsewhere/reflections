How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?

Only the differences were showns. Less places to look.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see the differences between working and non-working code.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
Google Docs does?

Pros: commits depends on user judgement, can be made at right logical time
Cons: commits depends on user judgement, can be made at wrong logical time


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In google docs files have no dependency.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows me commits with date
git diff uses id log has shown to compare those files


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

No fear of losing data and work.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Executing apps, saving apps, playing around.
