What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git gets created. It stores earlier versions of my files if i commited them.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

Creates space to files and allow to choose what files will be updated with 
commits.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

I can easily compare staging, latest commit and working directory
it is double - checked and easy to see what changes are made and commited.
